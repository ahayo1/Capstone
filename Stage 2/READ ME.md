## Phase 2: EDA & Model Construction

In the second part, students will:
* complete their data exploration stage (the dataset should be completely ready after appropraite cleansing and transformations; student is expected to be familiar with all the major patters and trends in the dataset)
* contruct their model (i.e. if it is a regression problem, then students should have their codes ready that are compatible with the dataset; if it is neural network implementaion, then students should complete at least one successful training, etc.)
* create a 3-5 minute long presentation summarizing their efforts
* update their P3
