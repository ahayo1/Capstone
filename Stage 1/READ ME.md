## Stage 1: Project Pitch, Literature Review, and EDA

As soon as the project is chosen, students will:
* make a brief literature/industry research to determine similar projects to their project
* learn from those studies' outcomes and differentiate their project than others
* plan and document the details of the planned implementation
* get familiar with their datasets and carry out transforations and cleansing, if necessary
* carry out some basic exploratory data analysis on their datasets
