## Stage 1: Project Pitch, Literature Review, and EDA

As soon as the project is chosen, students will:
* make a brief literature/industry research to determine similar projects to their project
* learn from those studies' outcomes and differentiate their project than others
* plan and document the details of the planned implementation
* get familiar with their datasets and carry out transforations and cleansing, if necessary
* carry out some basic exploratory data analysis on their datasets

The students will create a 3-5 minute presenation providing
* an introduction to the project
* an overview of similar approaches
* an introduction to the dateset
