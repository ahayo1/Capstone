## Stage 3: Execution and Interpretation

In the third phase, students will:
* come up with concrete outcomes (either their initial hypothesis work and why or "these are the outcomes with this much prediction according to method-x, etc.)
* discuss the performance of their model (in terms of accuracy and/or confidence levels)
* elaborate what could be done differently or what can be done next
* create a 5-minute long presentation summarizing these efforts
* update their P3

Files needed:
* book_covers.csv: sample of 100 rows for the genre mapping file for the book covers
* Capstone_Project_Book_Genres.ipyb: final Jupyter Notebook with code and results
