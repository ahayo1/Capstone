## Code
I tried two different data cleaning options for the book summary data. While the genre mappings in Option 1 and Option 2 are different for the book summary data, the rest of the code is the same. I noted the parts that were different within each Jupyter Notebook. I wanted to try both options to see if my results were different.
* Option 1: This code has both the code for the book summary data and the book cover data. For this particular book summary data, to do my genre mapping, I removed any genres that had less than 500 genres. This got me from 227 genres to 13 genres.
* Option 2: This code only has code for the book sumary data. For this particular book summary data, to do my genre mapping, I mapped all 227 genres to 7 genres.
